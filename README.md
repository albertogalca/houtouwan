# Houtouwan

Project description

---

Several decades ago, a small Chinese town was abandoned.

Completely depopulated, nature gradually took over, reclaiming every inch of concrete and covering it with a green mantle.

As if human life and nature had fused into one.

We’re talking about Houtouwan, a village in the Shengsi Archipelago, east of Shanghai.

Houtouwan didn’t die, as many believe. It changed. It transformed. We’ve created this template to build crearespaces.com, where we gather places that inspire us.

You can use it to transform those lists you have into directories. A new life. A new perspective. And the goal of survival (and sharing).
