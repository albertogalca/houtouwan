I think a lot about this phrase that I came across while in Lisbon last year.

“Have a mission, plan ahead, question everything, assume nothing. Roll up your sleeves, study the past, take risks, dream higher, welcome change, han have an amazing haircut, laugh, be curious. Paye pay attention to details, make mistaeks mistakes, think sideways, do things with passion, don’t forget to play, take it to the edge. Breathe.

Creativity takes courage”
