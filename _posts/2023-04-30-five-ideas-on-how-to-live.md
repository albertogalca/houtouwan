Welcome to this new Everything is a Remix’s edition, today’s remixes are:

- Everyone knows Tim Urban. If you haven’t read this article, you should: [Your Life in Weeks.](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html?utm_source=everythingisaremix&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter-no-02)
- I really like personal blogs. [This short post by Winnie Lim](https://winnielim.org/notes/beyond-my-control?utm_source=everythingisaremix&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter-no-02) left me with a phrase to reflect on: _“I think life is this long practice of constantly letting go, and a lot of forced letting go.”_

![The Contents of Your Week](/assets/images/posts/2024/01/https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2Fdf6a3539-7657-4eb0-a5f7-98e7d65e0e2b_867x620.png "The Contents of Your Week")

- _“There isn’t time, so brief is life, for bickering, apologies, heart burning, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that.”_

- Marty Bell is the [creator of Poolsuite](https://poolsuite.net/?utm_source=everythingisaremix&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter-no-02), which I have told you about before. [This manifesto](https://wepresent.wetransfer.com/stories/manifesto-marty-bell?utm_source=everythingisaremix&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter-no-02) is gold.

- Ryan is that kind of person who has different ideas, which I like to immerse myself in. I really liked [this post](https://www.ryanckulp.com/finding-happiness?utm_source=everythingisaremix&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter-no-02), so I’m sharing it with you.

Thanks for reading and see you next week.
