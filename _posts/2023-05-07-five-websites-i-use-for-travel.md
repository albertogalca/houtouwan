Welcome to this new Everything is a Remix’s edition, today’s remixes are in the mood to get on a plane:

1. If you like to travel by train you probably know this website: [Seat 61](https://www.seat61.com/?ref=everythingisaremix). To be honest the web is not pretty, but information is power and this web compiles a lot of information about train routes all over the world. It’s the best, trust me.
2. What Seat 61 is for trains is [Pack Hackers](https://packhacker.com/?ref=everythingisaremix) for backpacks. They have reviews of practically all the backpacks that exist today. Besides that, they have my favorite section: packing lists. For men, for girls, for digital nomads, for road trips. Check them out because they have a lot of information.
3. [Condé Nast Traveler](https://www.cntraveler.com/?ref=everythingisaremix) is my next choice when it comes to travel. They have travel guides for many parts of the world. I warn you that the places they recommend are often quite expensive. I mainly use it to look for restaurants, as sometimes they interview chefs from a specific area and recommend restaurants that they usually go to, this time of all prices.
4. For those who travel a lot in this vast world maybe having a card that generates points and gives you access to better offers and advantages would be great. I am still learning about it, but [The Point Guys](https://thepointsguy.com/?ref=everythingisaremix) website is the best I have found on this subject.
5. Martijn Doolaard is a Dutch photographer with a passion for cycling. He was so passionate about it that he rode two incredibly long routes on it: the first one from Amsterdam to Singapore with a duration of 1 year and the second one from Vancouver to Patagonia with a duration of 2 years. Just this week I discovered [his Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MartijnDoolaard?ref=everythingisaremix) and with it his new adventure: about a year ago he bought two stone cabins on top of a hill in the northern part of the Alps and from that time have been sharing the restoration process to turn them into his new home.

In the title I said that I would share with you fives websites that I use to travel, but the last point is not a website for traveling, right? Well, that’s absolutely right. If you have noticed in the description, you can see that I have been to 40 countries. The truth is that before writing this I had no idea (in fact I thought I had been to about 50). So here is [the fifth tool](https://douwe.com/projects/visited?region=world&ref=everythingisaremix).

Okay, now it is.

One last thing before I leave you. Since I have more recommendations than I share here, I’m going to move this newsletter to a directory for one main reason: that you have access to these remixes in an easy and filterable way.

As I still don’t know when this will be available, for the moment [I’ve created a very basic directory where I compile everything I share in this newsletter](https://raindrop.io/albertogalca/everything-is-a-remix-33652610?ref=albertogalca.com). Let me know what you do think or if you have any feedback on this.

Thanks for reading and see you next week.
