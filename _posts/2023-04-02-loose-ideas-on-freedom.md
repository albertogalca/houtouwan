I am on a flight to Singapore reading [Solatz](https://solatz.substack.com/?ref=albertogalca.com), a Spanish newsletter that shares ideas about freedom. Pursuing freedom has been a long-standing goal of mine, and I try to prioritize it in every decision I make. Over time, I’ve developed some brief opinions about freedom that I’d like to share with you today:

- **Freedom comes with responsibility, always.** There are people who use their freedom to make your life easier. It’s okay to give the same in return. Being free does not imply being an asshole.
- **Freedom sometimes involves being away from the people you love.** It involves going off to pursue what makes you feel light. Which you can do without the need for others to watch you.
- **Freedom can be daunting and intimidating from the outside**, but only the brave who dare to pursue it can truly enjoy it.
- **Freedom demands a lot from you, but it gives you more.** Be demanding with life and sooner or later you’ll be a little freer. Pursuing freedom is an active process – it won’t come to you on its own.
- **Freedom is asking yourself more questions than usual**, and at the same time knowing that we will probably never get the answers.
- **Freedom is not tied to any kind of identity.**<span style="color: var(--wp--preset--color--foreground); font-family: var(--wp--preset--font-family--system-font); font-size: var(--wp--preset--font-size--medium); background-color: var(--wp--preset--color--background);"> To be free is to know that there will be nothing that is “the normal” anymore.</span><span style="background-color: var(--wp--preset--color--background); color: var(--wp--preset--color--foreground); font-family: var(--wp--preset--font-family--system-font); font-size: var(--wp--preset--font-size--medium);"> </span>

Now it’s your turn, what are your thoughts on freedom?
