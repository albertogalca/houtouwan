I’m writing these lines from Hakone, a region near Tokyo from where I was supposed to have seen Mount Fuji but could not due to cloud banks between its mountain ranges.

The Japanese adventure is going well. I have been able to travel quite a few kilometers of Japan by train and enjoy Kyoto, which from now on I will name as “my favorite Asian city”.

I haven’t had much time to think of something to write these days between trains, walks, and sushi. That’s why I’m going to use the letter of recommendations to leave you one that I really like.

If you know me, you know that two of my passions are gastronomy and Italy. I don’t know how I didn’t discover it before, but not long ago I found out about the _Pasta Grannies_ channel.

This channel not only makes me hungry, but also teaches me one very important thing: that things that are slow-cooked taste better. They taste, they feel, they are made. You can use any verb you want.

And that’s all for today, I’m going to have breakfast because I’m hungry and in a couple of days I’ll be heading to Tokyo.

See you soon!

_PS: Any recommendation of channels similar to this one is more than welcome._
