I am spending August in Timișoara. A small town, for some boring, for me a haven of peace.

I am spending August quite cool, with temperatures of maximum 30 degrees, which for a person used to have a 45 degree August, is little.

I like the city. It’s small, walkable and has lots of parks. A beautiful city that was one of the first cities in Europe to have artificial light (one of the many curiosities you find in Wikipedia).

Without further ado, August is being for her.
