  <p class="text-2xl lg:text-4xl max-w-3xl mb-12">To use this library you have to pay. The price is 50 Taiwan dollars. In euros about â‚¬1.40 and in dollars $1.55. Which isn't much but it keeps it from being full.

They force you to take off your shoes. You have a small interior garden where you can go out and get some fresh air. The internet is good and being specialized in design you have thousands of magazines and books on the subject.

Sometimes they do events inside, but otherwise it's very quiet.</p>
