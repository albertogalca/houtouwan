  <p class="text-2xl lg:text-4xl max-w-3xl mb-12">This library is spacious and well-appointed, featuring cozy areas with sofas where you can relax and read, as well as comfortable tables for studying. The only downside is that it doesn't have Wi-Fi.

What we appreciate the most is the library's architecture. The design of the staircases and the distribution of the books are particularly fascinating.

We recommend visiting the library alone, either to read or simply to appreciate the architecture. While it may not be ideal for working due to the lack of internet, it's definitely worth a visit if you enjoy architectural beauty or want a peaceful place to read.</p>
