description: "It's located in the old town of Bangkok, specifically inside the Doble B Hostel.

This café is made of concrete and wood. Finding spaces with natural light in the old town is not easy due to its architecture, so they built it in such a way that it allows natural light to enter. A modern building that invites people to hang out in an open-air space in a four and a half-story shophouse.

I was quite surprised to find a place where I could spend the whole day working and sipping coffee without feeling hot because of the cool breeze that blows all day except during the very hot part of the day when there is a lot of natural light, the seating area in the center of the café can be a bit hot. The interior designer has designed a small room for those who don’t like Open Air spaces or during hot times.

Bite & Bond is open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Tuesdays through Sundays for individuals looking for a cup of coffee and pastries."
