  <p class="text-2xl lg:text-4xl max-w-3xl mb-12">It is located in the Asok neighborhood of Bangkok. 

It is an incredible space. It seems like you are inside a laboratory. Clean, pristine and minimalist. All in metal and white. It is a small oasis of freshness in the hot city. 
The chairs are not very comfortable if you are on the stools. The wifi is not very fast.

They are some of the best coffee experts there are. They only have a specialty and each type of coffee, designation of origin and grain is used to make a specific type of coffee. 

Its look is also very nice.

There are plugs for charging.</p>
