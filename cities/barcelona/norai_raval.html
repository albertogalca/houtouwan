  <p class="text-2xl lg:text-4xl max-w-3xl mb-12">Norai Raval is the restaurant of Museu Marítim de Barcelona located in the Ciutat Vella neighbourhood. 

By enjoying the Norai restaurant you will also be contributing to the Norai project, a social and training project that every year allows access to the labor market for people from the Raval neighborhood in vulnerable situations.

It is a very bright space thanks to its large window that overlooks the port and it’s big and open concept. </p>
